.SH "NAME"
\fBkadnode\fR \- P2P name resolution daemon
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBkadnode\fR [\-\-value\-id identifier] [\-\-port port] [\-\-daemon] [\.\.\.]
.
.P
\fBkadnode\-ctl\fR [\.\.\.]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBKadNode\fR is a small P2P name/resource resolution daemon for IPv4/IPv6 based on a distributed hash table (DHT)\. The implementation is identical to the one used for the Transmission Bittorrent client\.
.
.P
KadNode enables the user to announce any kind of resource by an identifier\. This can be used e\.g\. to resolve a hostname to an IP address\. It is also small in size (~75KB) and uses only one thread to save resources\. Join any existing swarm to be able to find your node globally\.
.
.P
By default, KadNode tries to send a ping to a multicast address on the local network to find nodes to bootstrap from\. This is done every five minutes when no other nodes are known\. The interactive remote shell \fBkadnode\-ctl\fR let the user import and export nodes, issue queries for identifiers and send announcements\.
.
.P
As an usage example start \fBkadnode\fR and enter \fBimport bttracker\.debian\.org\fR to help KadNode to bootstrap into an existing network\. The \fBstatus\fR command will let you see the rising number of known nodes\. To let KadNode announce to the network that the identifier \'myname\.p2p\' should resolve to your IP address, use \fBannounce myname\.p2p \-1\fR\. The second argument "\-1" is a special value and will cause Kadnode to keep the announcement alive for the entire runtime\. The same can be achieved using the \fB\-\-value\-id\fR argument at startup\. Any announcement will be dropped by other Kademlia DHT instances (such as Transmission) after 32 minutes and therefore need to be refreshed by KadNode around every 30 minutes\.
.
.P
Values like \fBmyname\.p2p\fR can be resolved by using the command \fBlookup myname\.p2p\fR\. The NSS (Network Service Switch) support on many Posix systems (e\.g\. Ubuntu) can intercept requests for the \.p2p top level domain and allows the value to be used e\.g\. in the web browser\.
.
.P
Please be aware that other people might use the same identifier\. It is strongly advised to do additional identification/authentication when an address is used that has been resolved by KadNode\. The DNS/NSS interfaces are only able to return one of these addresses\. In contrast, the web and console interface are able to return all known IP addresses associated with an identifier\.
.
.P
Every entered identifier (e\.g\. \fBmyname\.p2p\fR) will have everything after and including the last dot ignored\. This is because the top level domain is often used to differentiate from classical domain names and to redirect requests to KadNode\. The rest of the string is converted to an 20 byte identifier using the SHA1 hashing algorithm\. As an alternative, the hash can be entered directly as a 40 character hexadecimal string\. The string \fBmyname\.p2p\fR is therefore eqivalent to \fBd13b93ea42804188d277c20f7d6e5be2732148b8\fR which is the result of SHA1(\'myname\')\. The use of the build\-in hashing algorithm can be entirely circumvented this way\.

.SH "Authentication"
KadNode allows optional node authentication\. This means that you can lookup nodes using a public key and verify that those nodes are in posession of the corresponding secret key\. To generate a new key pair use \fBkadnode \-\-auth\-gen\-keys\fR\. Announce the secret key on a node e\.g\. via \fBkadnode \-\-value\-id <secret\-key>\fR and then lookup the nodes IP address on another computer using \fB<public\-key>\.p2p\fR in your browser or \fBkadnode\-ctl lookup <public\-key>\fR\.
.
.SH "Web Interface"
The optional web interface allows queries of these forms:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhttp://localhost:8053/lookup?foo\.p2p\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhttp://localhost:8053/announce?foobar\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBhttp://localhost:8053/blacklist?1\.2\.3\.4\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If the interface cannot be reached then the interface might be disabled (port set to 0) or not compiled in (check \fBkadnode \-\-version\fR)\. In case the IPv6 entry for localhost is not used or missing, try \fB[::1]\fR instead of \fBlocalhost\fR\.
.
.SH "NOTES"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This is not about traditional DNS\. Everybody can announce everything\. You need to decide which
.
.br
of the resolved IP addresses you trust\. Be random about the identifiers you announce\. When retrieved
.
.br
IP addresses do not deliver/verify for you, then you should blacklist those IP addresses\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Blacklisted addresses are stored in a LRU cache of maximal 10 entries\.
